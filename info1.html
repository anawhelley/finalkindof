                PM stands for particulate matter (also called particle pollution): 
                the term for a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found 
                in the air. Some particles, such as dust, dirt, soot, or smoke, are 
                large or dark enough to be seen with the naked eye. Others are so 
                small they can only be detected using an electron microscope.

            <h2>
                Particulate matter contains microscopic solids or liquid droplets 
                that are so small that they can be inhaled and cause serious health 
                problems. Some particles less than 10 micrometers in diameter can get 
                deep into your lungs and some may even get into your bloodstream. Of 
                these, particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, also known as 
                fine particles or PM2.5, pose the greatest risk to health.
                <br>Fine particles are also the main cause of reduced visibility (haze) 
                in parts of the United States, including many of our treasured national parks and wilderness areas.
